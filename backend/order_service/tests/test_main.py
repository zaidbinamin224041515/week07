# week07/backend/order_service/tests/test_main.py

"""
Integration tests for the Order Service API.
These tests verify the functionality of the API endpoints by
making actual HTTP requests to the running FastAPI application.
Each test runs within its own database transaction for isolation,
which is rolled back after the test completes.
Crucially, these tests also mock the external HTTP calls to the Product Service
to control its responses and test stock deduction scenarios.
